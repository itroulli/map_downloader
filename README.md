> A python script made to download the official greek daily Fire Risk Prediction Map

Every day, during the summer period, the greek General Secretariat of Civil Protection releases a Fire Risk Map. This script checks every minute and if the map with the prediction for the next day is available, it downloads it and renames it to my preferable format.

***At the moment, there are no maps published because the 2019 summer period hasn't started yet.**
 
 Example of the downloaded file:
